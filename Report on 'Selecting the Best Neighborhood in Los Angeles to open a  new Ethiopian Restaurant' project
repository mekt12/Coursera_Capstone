# Selecting the Best Neighborhood in Los Angeles to open a new Ethiopian Restaurant
# Introduction
Running a successful restaurant business in any city is hard. Most restaurants close within a short period of time after opening, because they are not profitable. Therefore, considering all the factors that affect the success of the restaurant is important.
One of the important factors that affect the restaurant business is its location. In this project, we will try to find the best location to open a new Ethiopian restaurant in Los Angeles, CA. We consider the density of other restaurants in the neighborhoods, and next the density of Ethiopian restaurants in the neighborhoods. So we would not have many competitors surrounding our restaurant. 
This problem is important to solve for stakeholders, such as any person who is interested in opening a new Ethiopian restaurant in Los Angeles.
# Data
We will use three data sources to solve the problem.
1)	We will get the list of neighborhoods of Los Angeles, CA  by scraping a Wikipedia page.
2)	We will get Latitude and Longitude coordinates of the neighborhoods, in order to plot maps and use the coordinates to get venue data. We will use Python Geocoder package to get the coordinates.
3)	We will get venue data, especially restaurants and particularly Ethiopian restaurants, in these neighborhoods using Foursquare API.
We will use this data to perform clustering on the neighborhoods.
